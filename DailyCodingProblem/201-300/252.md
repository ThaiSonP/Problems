This problem was asked by Palantir.

The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, 4 / 13 can be represented as 1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction a / b, where a < b, into an Egyptian fraction.

<!-- understanding the question -->

4/13 = 144/468

1 / 468 (divide by 13 - factor of 36)        1/468
1 / 18  (divide 468 by 18 - factor of 26)   26/468
1 / 4   (divide 468 by 4 - factor of 117)  117/468
