This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string. For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return [0, 7].

<!-- attempt at solving -->
a b r a c a d a b r a
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Looking at the positions of all the letters, the function returns ONLY the beginning of the pattern.

Using a for loop, the function will look for the pattern and only add the beginning index to the list of solutions.


const 211 = (word,pattern)=>{

  let solutions = []

  for(let i = 0; i < word.length; i++){
    if(word.split(i , i+pattern.length ) === pattern){
      solutions.push(word[i])
    }
  }

  return solutions
}
