This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Given a string and a pattern, find the starting indices of all occurrences of the pattern in the string. For example, given the string "abracadabra" and the pattern "abr", you should return [0, 7].

<!-- attempt at solving -->
a b r a c a d a b r a
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Looking at the positions of all the letters, the function returns ONLY the beginning of the pattern.
