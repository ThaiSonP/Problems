You come across a dictionary of sorted words in a language you've never seen before. Write a program that returns the correct order of letters in this language.

For example, given ['xww', 'wxyz', 'wxyw', 'ywx', 'ywz'], you should return ['x', 'z', 'w', 'y'].

<!-- plan -->
1. Go by the first letter of every word
X , W , Y
2. Go by the last letter in every word
X, Z , W, Y
