Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".

Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

//Attempt to solvie problem:

Thought process:

1. I know I need to iterate through each letter to count the number of accurances per letter.
2. I need a counter to keep track of each letter
3. I need to reset counter when I get to a new letter
4. I do not need to sort the letters or else I change the occurance of each letter

const countLetters = (word)=>{

  let output = ""
  let count = 1;

  for (let i = 0;i<word.length;i++){
  
    if(word[i] === word[i+1]){
     
      count = count+1;
    
      }else{
      
        output = `${output}${count}${word[i]}`;
      
        count = 1;
    
      }
  
  }
  
  return output

}

countLetters("AAAABBBCCDAA")
