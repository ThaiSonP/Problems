This problem was asked by Stripe.

Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.


- attempt #1: brute force

const findLow = (input) =>{
  let answer = 1

  for (let i = 0; i<input.length ; i++){
    if(input.includes(answer)){
      answer++
    }
  }

  return answer
}

i am iterating through one for loop that will compare the lowest possible positive solution to every element in the array and only then will it know to iterate or not. Run time - runs on O(N)
