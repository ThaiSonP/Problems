This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

For example, given the query string de and the set of strings [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].

Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.

##
let attempt#1 = (list,test)=>{
  let answer = []

  for(let i = 0;i<list.length;i++){
    if(list[i].includes(test)){
      answer.push(list[i])
    }
  }
  return answer
}

attempt#1(input1,input2)


Problems with attempt#1:
  Includes doesn't focus directly at the begining of the word.
