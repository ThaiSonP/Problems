This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

-An alphanumeric string is a string that contains only alphabets from a-z, A-Z and some numbers from 0-9.-
