This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

shorten(url), which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.
restore(short), which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.
Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

-An alphanumeric string is a string that contains only alphabets from a-z, A-Z and some numbers from 0-9.-

Attempt #1:
- Using the definition of an alphanumeric string our priorities are to make sure that the string included BOTH numbers AND strings. 
- I created a list of numbers as a book to compare each character of the url to because it would be easier to just focus on the numbers aspect of the problem
- case1 is to make sure the a the URL includes a number
- case2 is to make sure the URL is not entirely a number
- case3 is to make sure we have something to shortern

const checkalphanumeric = (url)=>{
  const numbs = ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']
  
  // case1 is if the url includes a number
  var case1 = false
  
  for(let i = 0;i<url.length;i++){
    if(numbs.includes(url[i])){
      case1 = true;
      break
    }
  }

  // case2 is if the url is entirely made of numbers
  var case2 = true
  for(let i=0;i<url.length;i++){
    if(!numbs.includes(url[i])){
      case2 = false;
      break;
    }
  }

  url = url.slice(0,6)
  var case3 = url.length>=6

  if(case1 && !case2 && case3){
    return url;
  }return null

}
