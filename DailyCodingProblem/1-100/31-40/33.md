This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.

Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.

For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out:
2
1.5
2
3.5
2
2
2

const printMedian =(inputAry)=>{
    let sample = []
    for(let i = 0;i<inputAry.length;i++){
      <!-- we're inputing one by one and sorting this new ary so we do not tamper with the input -->
      sample.push(inputAry[i]);
      sample.sort();
      <!-- if odd number of elements -->
      if(i%2===0){
        console.log(sample[i/2])
        }else{
          <!-- else condition handling all event elements -->
        console.log((sample[Math.floor(i/2)]+sample[Math.ceil(i/2)])/2)
        }
    }
  }
