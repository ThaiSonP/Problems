The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three: substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.

Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.

const attempt1 = (word1,word2)=>{
  let temp = ''
  <!-- setting to make sure word2 is always the longer word -->
  if(word1.length > word2.length){
    temp = word1;
    word1 = word2;
    word2 = temp
  }

  let differences = 0

  for(let i =0;i<word2.length;i++){
    if(word1[i]!=word2[i]){
      <!-- assuming word1 is shorter than word2 at i it will be an undefined against a real character and increase the increment  -->
      differences++
    }
  }
  return differences
}
