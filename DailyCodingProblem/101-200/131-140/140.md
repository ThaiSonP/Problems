Given an array of integers in which two elements appear exactly once and all other elements appear exactly twice, find the two elements that appear only once.

For example, given the array [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 2, 6, 10], return 4 and 8. The order does not matter.

Follow-up: Can you do this in linear time and constant space?


Attempt #1:

 -I want to create an object to keep track of the integer and how many times they occur.
 
 -I split the object by their keys and values to directly pick which integer appears only once.
 
 -Once I find the index of the integer with the value of one I use that same index to identify which integer it is by comaring it to the index of the keyes.
 

const findSingle = (list)=>{

  let counter = {}

  for(let i = 0;i<list.length;i++){
  
    if(counter[list[i]]){
  
     counter[list[i]]++
    
    }else{
    
      counter[list[i]]=1
    }
    
  }

  var keys = Object.keys(counter)
  
  var values = Object.values(counter)

  let solution = []

  for(let i = 0;i<values.length;i++){
  
    if(values[i]===1){
    
      solution.push(keys[i])
      
    }
    
  }

  return solution

}
