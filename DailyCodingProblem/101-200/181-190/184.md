This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given n numbers, find the greatest common denominator between them.

For example, given the numbers [42, 56, 14], return 14.

attempt #2:

const findGreatest = (inst)=>{
  inst =  inst.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let smallest = inst[0]
  let variables = []

  for (let i =1;i<=smallest;i++){
    if(smallest%i===0){
      variables.push(i)
    }
  }
  variables = variables.sort((a,b)=>b-a);
  let inc = 0
  let large = variables[inc]
  let largest

  let test = inst.every(el =>{
    return el%large===0
  })

  while(!test){
    inc++;
    large = variables[inc];
    test = inst.every(el =>{
    return el%large===0
    })
  }

  largest = large
  return largest
}

findGreatest([42, 56, 14])
