This problem was asked by MongoDB.

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than half the time (> floor(len(lst) / 2.0)).

You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0], return 1.

Plan:
  Iterate through the list to with an object to keep track of how frequently a number occurs with the kay as the element and the occurrence as the value.

  Use Math.max to find the highest value to get the index of the highest key and return it with using Object.keys
