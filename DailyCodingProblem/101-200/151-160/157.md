Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

Attempt #1:
  - Iterate through the entire word and keep count of all the letters.
  - Count the number of odd letters.
  - If there is more than 1 number of odd letters then it cannot be a palindrome.
