Delete a minimal number of elements from an array so that all elements of the modified array are equal to one another.


Attempt #1:
 - Create an object to count the number of elements and see which element has the most. 
 - I can subtract the number of times the element that has appeared the most from the total number of elements for the solution.
 - If none of the elements are appearing more than the others than the solution will be total number of elements -1
