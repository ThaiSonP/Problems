This problem was asked by Jane Street.

cons(a, b) constructs a pair, and car(pair) and cdr(pair) returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, car(cons(3, 4)) returns 3, and cdr(cons(3, 4)) returns 4.

Given this implementation of cons:

def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair

Implement car and cdr.

* the example is written in python
  - cons is a function that takes in two variables and invokes pair with (those two variables)
  - pair is a function that returns (a,b)

attempt #1 in python:
https://repl.it/repls/PhonyPerfumedCalculators

def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair

f = lambda n, m: (n , m)
car = lambda n, m: n
cdr = lambda n, m: m
print(cons(2, 3)(f))
print(cons(2, 3)(car))
print(cons(2, 3)(cdr))

* required knowledge lambda
 - A lambda function is a small anonymous function.
 - A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.

attempt #2 in node:
https://repl.it/repls/OutrageousFlatAcrobat

class cons {
  constructor(a,b) {
    this.pair = [a,b];
  }
  car(){
    return this.pair[0]
  }
  cdr(){
    return this.pair[1]
  }
}

test = new cons(3,4)
test.car()
test.cdr()
