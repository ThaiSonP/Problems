The area of a circle is defined as πr^2. Estimate π to 3 decimal places using a Monte Carlo method.

Hint: The basic equation of a circle is x2 + y2 = r2.

Initial attempt #1

function getRandomIntInclusive(r) {
  min = 0;
  max = r;
  let chance = 0
// chance is my counter to see the probability of picking a point within a square (of (2r)^2) and falling within the biggest possible circle inside the square

  for (let i = 0;i<=1000;i++){
    let x = Math.random() * (max - min ) + min;
    let y = Math.random() * (max - min ) + min; 
    if(x^2+y^2 < r^2){
      chance++
    }
  }
  //  the Monte Carlo method depends on randomly selecting points and calculating the number of points within a the circle to determine pi with it's equation of pi / 4 = points within the circle / points total - in our formula we are choosing a total of 1000 points
  return (chance*4)/1000  
}
