This problem was asked by Twitter.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

* record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
* get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

<!-- attempt #1   -->
let log = [4,7,8,1,3]

const record = (id)=>{
  log.push(id)
}

const get_last =(i)=>{
  if(i>log.length){
    return ("unable to compute")
  }
  return (log[log.length-i])
}

<!-- attempt #2 -->
class Log {
  constructor()
  {
    this.log = []
  }
  record (order_id){
    this.log.push(order_id)
  }
  get_last(i){
    if(i>this.log.length){
      return ("I is too large")
    }
    return (this.log[this.log.length-i])
  }
}
