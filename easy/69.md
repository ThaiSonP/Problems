This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.

For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.

You can assume the list has at least three integers.

Attempt 1:

const largest = (list)=>{
  // the first thing i want to do is sort the list so it makes things easier for me to find the variables I want:
  list = list.sort(function(a,b){return a-b})
  
  // list = [-10,-10,2,5]
  var last = list[list.length-1]
  // 5
  var one = list[list.length-2]
  //2
  var two = list[list.length-3]
  //-10  
  
  switch(true){
    case last < 0;
      //assuming the last item is negative then the whole list would be negative:
      return last * one * two;
      break;
    case last * one < list[0] * list[1]:
      //assuming the first few items are negative AND they can create a larger product than our last two items
      return (list[0]*list[1]*last);
      break;
    default:
      //our default case is to multiply everything in the end of the list 
      return (last*one*two)
  }
}
