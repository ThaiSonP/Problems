This problem was asked by Microsoft.

A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.

Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.

For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.


Attempt #1: https://repl.it/@ThaiSonP/70#index.js
// I noticed a simple patern where you can subtract n from ten to get the n-th perfect number but it only applies to the first 10 didgets

const thing = (number,solution='')=>{
  if(1 <= number && number < 10){
    solution = +`${solution}${number}${10-number}`;
    return solution
  }
  
}
