This problem was asked by Google.

The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. Write a function that, given a set, generates its power set.

For example, given the set {1, 2, 3}, it should return {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.

You may also use a list or array to represent a set

<!-- attempt 1 -->

const attempt = (inputSet)=>{
  let output = new Set ([[]])

  for(let i = 0;i<inputSet.length;i++){
    output.add(new Set([inputSet[i]]))
  }
  for(let i = 0;i<inputSet.length;i++){
    for(let x = 0;x<inputSet.length;x++){
      output.add(new Set([inputSet[x],inputSet[i]]))
    }
  }
  return output
}

<!-- Output:
Set {  [], Set { 1 }, Set { 2 },
Set { 3 }, Set { 1 }, Set { 2, 1 },
Set { 3, 1 }, Set { 1, 2 }, Set { 2 },
Set { 3, 2 }, Set { 1, 3 }, Set { 2, 3 }, Set { 3 } } -->

<!-- problems with the first attempt: even thought i used sets to avoid duplicates it did not help stop duplicates from being used throughout the output set - i was also unable to get set [1,2,3] in the end  -->
